# WatchWash
Hand washing app specific to the Apple Watch


## Technologies Used

- WatchKit
- Swift
- UserDefaults
- Watchkit Storyboards
- NotificationCenter

## App Design

- Independent WatchOS app
- Targeted for WatchOS 6
- Timer that can keep track of how long you wash your hands for
- Set reminders for times of the day to wash your hands
- Change wash length of time

## Purpose

The purpose and design of this app was to learn WatchKit development and attempt to release an app that could assist in timing how long it takes to wash your hands for personal health. 
However, with the recent COVID-19 pandemic the app was denied by Apple for sale on the App Store as it too closely related to the COVID-19 restrictions they placed on apps. 
As a result, it exists here as a profile piece to show my knowledge/experience with WatchOS development.
